          <h2> Connecting Furloughed Healthcare Workers with Healthcare Facilities in Need </h2>
          <p>
            <strong> Louisiana Health Work Connect</strong> is an initiative organized by
            the State of Louisiana Department of Health in response to COVID-19 to help facilities
            with acute healthcare staffing shortages fill those vacancies with qualified candidates
            who are otherwise out of work.

                <h4>HEALTHCARE WORKERS </h4><br/>

                <h4>What workers can participate? </h4>
                <p>
                  Licensed or retired, furloughed, and out-of-work healthcare workers willing
                  to work in Louisiana can submit their information to be considered for employment.
                </p>

                <h4>I’m an interested healthcare worker.  How do I participate?</h4>
                <p>
                  Please fill in <Link href="/candidate-intake"><a>this form</a></Link> to submit your information.
                </p>

                <h4>I don’t live in Louisiana but want to help. Can I participate?</h4>
                <p>
                  Yes. We hope to find jobs for our furloughed neighbors so we will be prioritizing filling open
                  positions with qualified Louisiana residents. However, if we aren’t able to fill a critical
                  hospital need with in-state providers, we will be expanding the reach beyond state lines.
                </p>

                <h4>Do I need to have an active license?</h4>
                <p>
                  No. Facilities are prioritizing workers who can begin immediately, but will also consider
                  recently retired individuals who are in good standing with their respective licensing board.
                </p>

                <h4>How much will I get paid? Do I have to travel?</h4>
                <p>
                  The specific conditions of your employment, like pay and location, will be negotiated between
                  you and the individual facilities. Before being hired, you will have an opportunity to discuss
                  details like this with your potential future employer.
                </p>

                <h4>I’m not looking for a job, but I want to help. What should I do? </h4>

                  The program is currently being piloted in Baton Rouge, LA. Any licensed nursing home
                  or hospital (both Tier 1 and 2) in <a href="http://ldh.la.gov/assets/docs/OrgCharts/RegionMap.jpg">
                  Louisiana Department of Health Region 2</a> (Baton Rouge area) can participate in Louisiana Health Work Connect.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <em>Coming soon:</em> any hospital or nursing home in the state of Louisiana.
                </p>

                <h4>I’m an interested Louisiana healthcare facility.  How do I participate?</h4>
                <p>
                  In recognition of the pressure many facilities are facing, this program is being rolled out as
                  quickly as possible. It will initially launch as a pilot in the DoH Region 2 (Baton Rouge area) for
                  Tier 1 and Tier 2 hospitals, and nursing homes. Based on the lessons learned during the pilot, it
                  will transition to a statewide program as rapidly as possible.
                  <br/><br/>
                  If you are a Human Resources representative with a hospital or nursing home in Region 2 and
                  have not received information about this program, please first contact your internal LDH
                  emergency management liaison. For all other inquiries, please use the <a href="/feedback">feedback form</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>How do I receive information about interested applicants?</h4>
                <p>
                  If you are a validated participating member of Louisiana Health Work Connect, a tailored
                  spreadsheet of applicants will be emailed to the Human Resources representative designated
                  on the intake form.
